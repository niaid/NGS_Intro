# Geneious for viewing alignment

1. Import GFF3 and genome FASTA file.
2. Import sam file.
3. In contig view - advanced options (gear tab on right hand side), ensure "Vertically compress contig" is checked.
4. Under home tab, color by paired distance.
5. Insert sizes shows estimate of fragment sizes.
6. Back to contig view - zoom in to see bases.
7. Change threshold for second tab from Highest Quality to 100% Identical.  Under highlighting, choose ambiguities and check "Use dots".
8. On Graphs tab, you can highlight regions of differing coverage.
9. Can annotate regions of high coverage with Annotate and predict.
