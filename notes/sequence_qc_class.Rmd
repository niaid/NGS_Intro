# Sequencing intro

---

##  DNA polymerisation
![](assets/img/image10.png)

+ In nature, during DNA replication, the purpose of DNA polymerisation is to add the next complementary base to the new strand.
+ The purpose of sequencing is to **figure out what that next base added is**
+ **This is where the various sequencing technologies differ**

---

## Basic steps: Sample to data
+ Protocol depends on sample type and sequencing type.

1. Extract the DNA.  
2. Library preparation.
    + Fragmenting the DNA.
    + Adding *adapter* sequences to the ends.
3. Template amplication*
    + Clonal amplification of the fragments to ensure a clear signal.
4. Sequencing*

\*3 & 4 take place in the sequencing machine.

#  Sequence data 

+ What it looks like, types, quality

---

##  Single End vs Paired End vs Mate-Pair

```{r, out.height = outh("600px"), echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image19.svg")
```



---

##  Adapters, Primers, Indexes 

+ Reads from a sequencer may have extra sequences on either end that we should remember are there
+ Indexes are used by the sequencer to separate data into separate sample files – **demultiplex**

```{r, out.height = outh("500px"), echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image20.svg")
```

##  Anatomy of an Illumina Run 

+ What comes out of the sequencer?

##  Converting and Demultiplexing 

+ Illumina sequencer can convert & demux itself
+ [bcl2fastq](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html)
	+ Converts BaseCalls to FASTQ
	+ Demultiplexes the data
		+ Reads that it can't figure out goes into files called "Undetermined"
		+ Should check if the Undetermined files are unreasonably Large
		+ Uses SampleSheet.csv to map barcodes to samples
+ Other tools

#  Files

---

## File Formats

+ Sequence Data
	+ FASTA/QUAL
	+ FASTQ
	+ FAST5 - nanopore
	+ Older formats – sff
+ Alignment Data
	+ SAM
	+ BAM
	+ BED


---

##  FASTA and/or QUAL 

+ Sequence and quality scores are separate files – old data
+ Or FASTA only with no quality data available
	+ Pre-processed in some way
+ Header
+ Sequence
	+ All on one line
	+ Or it will be truncated – 80-120 characters
![](assets/img/image14.png)

---

## FASTQ

- Sequence and quality in single file

```
@M03213:59:000000000-AWR6D:1:1101:12406:1145 1:N:0:NCCTGAGC+NTATTAAG
GTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATAACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCACGCAGGCGG
+
-6,ACGGAEFGGG<<FFG?FC@EF8AFCFGEGGCCCBGGGGGGDGGGGGEEFA<FGCE,EFDCFFFGGGGCCDG
```

### Header

`@<instrument>:<run number>:<flowcell>:<lane>:<tile>:<x-pos>:<y-pos>  <read>:<is filtered>:<control number>:<sample number>`

- Read identifier is the beginning part (before the space)
- The end part (after the space) is used for demuxing or PE information

### Raw sequence
- All on one line - no spaces - DNA or RNA, should be one of the [IUPAC characters](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html).


---

##  FASTQ Quality Scores
+ called **Phred** scores after the inventor **Ph**il Green.


### How are they calculated?
1. Phred score $Q$:  Given $p$, the probability that the corresponding base call is incorrect,  
$Q = -10\log_{10} p$. 
    + 40 is usually highest score – very, very rarely up to 60
2. Add constant: $Q+C$
    + usually, $C = 33$ &rarr; Phred+33 format is most common (Illumina > 1.8 ~2011)
3. This value, $Q+C$, is encoded as an [ASCII](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) character in the FASTQ file.

```{r fastqbreak, results='asis', include=!fmt, echo=F}
cat(".pull-left[<img src='assets/img/image16.png' />]

.pull-right[<img src='assets/img/image17.png' />]

---
    
## Example    ")
```

```
@M03213:59:000000000-AWR6D:1:1101:12406:1145 1:N:0:NCCTGAGC+NTATTAAG
GTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATAACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCACGCAGGCGG
+
-6,ACGGAEFGGG<<FFG?FC@EF8AFCFGEGGCCCBGGGGGGDGGGGGEEFA<FGCE,EFDCFFFGGGGCCDG
```

*Example*  
First quality character is `-` which is *45* in the ASCII table.  
$Q = 45-33 = 12$

```{r conditional_block4,  results='asis', eval=!fmt, echo=F}
cat(".pull-left[<img src='assets/img/image16.png' />]

.pull-right[<img src='assets/img/image17.png' height='400'/>]
")
```

```{r conditional_block5,  results='asis', eval=fmt, echo=F}
writeLines("<p float='center'><img src='assets/img/image16.png' width=500 align='top' /><img src='assets/img/image17.png' width=300 /></p>")
```

???

Line 3 is single `+`  

Phred+33 is Sanger standard. Illumina switched around different standards for a while and settled back to Phred+33.
Starting with Illumina 1.3-1.7 used Phred+64.
Illumina 1.5-1.7 if quality scores were below Q15 at end of read, were arbitrarily assigned score 2 which is `B`.

##  Convert from FASTQ to FASTA 

+ FASTX-Toolkit
+ SRA-toolkit – download data and automatically convert


---

##  How to assess data quality? 

+ The sequencing lab runs quality-control tests to ensure that the actual run was successful.
+ We should run our own QC prior to analysis
	+ We should all be skeptics! To avoid misinterpretation of the data due to unexpected bias
+ QC measurements can report the following:
	+ Percent GC in sample reads
	+ Presence of overrepresented kmers and sequences such as adapters
	+ Per base quality score
	+ Distribution of nucleotide bases
+ After mapping reads to a genome, additional test could be run to determine:
	+ Mapping error rate
	+ Percent of possible PCR duplicates (reads with same start and end position in reference genome)
	+ Distribution of insert size (pair ends)

+ BaseSpace Tips: https://blog.horizondiscovery.com/diagnostics/the-5-ngs-qc-metrics-you-should-know
+ Different types of data require different QC metrics
	+ Example: whole genome shotgun vs amplicon

#  Improving Data Quality 

Trimming and Filtering

---

##  Trimming 

+ Adapter/primer trimming
	+ Remove these sequences from the ends of reads
	+ Useful for assembly, amplicon data
+ Quality Trimming
	+ Remove poor quality sequence from ends of reads
	+ Filter out poor quality reads


---

+ Trimmomatic - http:// www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic

#  MAPPING 



---

##  Why do you map reads to a reference? 

+ Reference guided assembly
	+ DNA- seq – genome assembly
	+ RNA- seq – transcriptome assembly
+ Variant calling
+ RNA- seq gene expression
+ Removing host background/contaminants

---

##  Reference Genomes 

+ Where to get them?
	+ Assemble it yourself
	+ Download it from NCBI – either by searching or by citation
+ Assess their quality
	+ Very few genomes are assembled with care and finished!  We need to keep our skepticism!
	+ Number of contigs vs number of chromosomes
	+ Contig lengths
	+ especially at then end of the genome fasta file
